	abstract = {A new method is proposed for the simultaneous measurement of the ultrasonic wave velocity and the thickness of a solid plate with access from only one side. A line-contact transmitter and a line-contact receiver were placed on the same side of the specimen, and the times of flight were measured for varying distance between the transducers. The ultrasonic wave velocity and the thickness of the specimen can be simultaneously determined from the relationship between the time of flight and the ultrasonic beam path. A least-squares fitting routine was employed to increase the accuracy of the measurements. Experimental results for several specimens of different materials as well as different thicknesses show good agreement with those measured by conventional methods.},
