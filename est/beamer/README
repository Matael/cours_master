These are 2 files :

- beamer.tex uses a custom theme (named "m") that can be found here : https://github.com/matze/mtheme . It also uses a
  custom font, Mozilla Fira Sans which can be downloaded here : https://github.com/mozilla/Fira
  You might not be able to compile it without xelatex and the 2 previously cited packages.
- beamer_singapore.tex uses the Singapore theme (part of the standard library) and should compile directly using latex
  or pdflatex
